# Wordle Clone
Welcome to the Wordle Clone! This project is a recreation of the popular word-guessing game "Wordle" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. Each guess provides feedback indicating which letters are correct and in the correct position, which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are incorrect.

### Features
- Interactive UI with real-time feedback
- Word validation and feedback system
- Simple and clean design

### Technologies Used

### Usage
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Enter a five-letter word in the input field.
3. Click "Enter" or press the "Enter" key to submit your guess.
4. Use the feedback provided to make subsequent guesses.
5. You have six attempts to guess the correct word.

### Game Rules
1. The game selects a random five-letter word at the start.
2. Players have six attempts to guess the word.
3. After each guess, the letters will change color to provide feedback:
- Green: The letter is correct and in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
- Grey: The letter is incorrect.
4. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or exhausts all six attempts.
